If the fonts are rendering tiny on your screen try loading bigger fonts:

 $ setfont ter-132b

There are more sizes available, try `ter-118b` or `ter-128b`.

Load a custom keymap with `loadkeys <locale>`:

 $ loadkeys es

There is a README in the current dir with some helpful snippets and more information.
Note that you only have wired internet support.
For a list of the included tools cat TOOLS file in the same directory.
